## Project Structure

Key directories and their purposes:

- **`app/`**: Next.js App Router with pages, layouts, and API routes
  - `(auth)/`: Authentication pages
  - `(root)/`: Authenticated user dashboard and pages
  - `api/`: API routes
  - `interview/`: Interview-related pages

- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components
  - `custom/`: Feature-specific components
  - `ui/`: Base UI components (Shadcn UI)

- **`constants/`**: Application-wide constants
- **`contexts/`**: React Context providers
- **`firebase/`**: Firebase configuration
- **`lib/`**: Utility functions and server actions
- **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions

## Coding Standards

1. **TypeScript**: Strict typing is enforced. Avoid `any` types.
2. **React**: Use functional components with hooks.
3. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Custom styles go in `globals.css`.
4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Components: outside the custom should be PascalCase (e.g., `InterviewCard.tsx`)
   - Custom Components: file name should be kebab-case
   - Files: kebab-case for non-components (e.g., `auth.action.ts`)
5. **Commit Messages**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
6. **Imports**: Group and order imports as:
   ```typescript
   // 1. External libraries
   import React from 'react';
   // 2. Internal components
   import { InterviewCard } from '@/components/InterviewCard';
   // 3. Styles
   import styles from './styles.module.css';
   ```
